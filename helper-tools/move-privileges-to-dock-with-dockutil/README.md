# Moving Privileges App

You can use a tool like `dockutil` to move **Privileges.app** to the dock once it installs. `dockutil` must be installed on the target machine prior to running this script. The script will exit with a failure if it does not find `dockutil`.


**NOTE**: The original `dockutil` repo has not been updated to support Python 3. A Fork of the project that incorporates changes for Python 3 can be found on GitHub [here]()


## Example Script

```
#!/usr/bin/env sh



```
